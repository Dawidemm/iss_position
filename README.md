# iss_position

A Python project that analyzes the location of the international space station.

This project involves fetching api data, using python core functions,
and using libraries like matplotlib, pandas, numpy. The results of the 
program are presented in a graphical form of dependencies, such as 
georaphic longitude and latitude. In the future, I plan to create a
prediction system of iss position.
